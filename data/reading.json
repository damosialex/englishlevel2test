Old-fashioned high street shops are back!\n\nOld-fashioned with a twist, that is. I've been to see one of the new Flow Stores that are opening across the country. You walk in, take what you want, and walk out. No checkouts. No queues. No staff. Just cameras watching your every move and technology tracking what you pick up.\n\nSounds convenient, doesn't it? But at what cost? These stores eliminate jobs. They collect your personal data. They track your movements. Is this really the future we want?\n\nThe technology is impressive, I'll admit. But I can't help feeling we're giving up something important - human connection, privacy, and jobs - all for the sake of saving a few minutes at the checkout.",
